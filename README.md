# Beginner Arduino Class

In 2016 I taught a classed titled **Electronics & Sculpture** in the Peck School of the Arts at the [https://uwm.edu/](University of Wisconsin Milwaukee). I often referred to the class as "Arduino for Artists".

Basically, it was teaching art students, some of whom never programmed or wrote any code, how to activate their art using the [Arduino](https://arduino.cc/) platform.

We had five concept we wanted to cover:

1. Digital Input
2. Digital Output
3. Analog Input
4. Analog Output (PWM)
5. Serial Communications

In 2017 I moved on to teaching the class at [Milwaukee Makerspace](https://milwaukeemakerspace.org/) and I refined the curriculum a bit to resemble very closely what you'll see in these files. I used components I had available. _(Note: I should add a parts list at some point)._

In 2018 I started teaching the class at **Brinn Labs**, usually with the help of Becky Yoshikane (friend, former coworker, former student, and former classmate). We taught the class all through 2018 and a few times in 2019.

I no longer teach the Beginner Arduino Class, but I wanted to share the files in case anyone else could find them useful.

Each lesson contains an Arduino sketch and a wiring diagram (as a [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/) file, and a PNG file). In some cases there are also images showing components, and most of the sketches should have links to the concepts/functions used in the sketch.
